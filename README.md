# PalinedromeChecker
A code response to Sololearn's Code Coach Challenge titled, "It's a Sign". The code should take four words, each on a separate line, as input, then determine if one of those words is a palindrome. Should there be a palindrome, the code should output "Open" and "Trash" if none of the words meets this condition. Output is a single word string.
